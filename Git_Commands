To do the equivalent of saving on git:

    -Save the file in its current location
    -navigate to the file in its folder in the git terminal
    -git diff to display the changes
    -git add --all to stage all the changes made
    -git add main.txt
         Stages the file main.txt
    -git reset main.txt
         Unstages the file main.txt
    -git commit -m 'message'
        The -m signifies that a message will follow
    -git push origin master
        'Pushes' the changes to the master branch on your computer
    -git pull origin master
        'Pulls' the changes from the master branch to you computer
    -git log 
        Shows the history of commits along with their distinct commit name
    -git checkout cf3080
        Displays the file contents at the time of that commit
    -git checkout master
        Displays the most recent commits made to the master branch
    -git checkout -- 'filename'
        Changes the file to the way it was before the last commit
    -git diff --staged
        Displays the differences in all of the currently staged files
